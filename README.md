# Fruits-360-classification-using-VGG
Kaggle's Fruits-360 classification into 120 classes using VGG (transfer learning).

In this project we utilized the pretrained model VGG16 to achieve great results on a classification problem containing as many as 120 classes.

I highly recommend you to view the .ipynb file (jupyter notebook). But for hardcore programmers i have provided the python file as well.
There are a lot of comments within the code so you shouldn't have any problem understanding what's going on.

I did the project on google colabotary and thus in the first few steps I have shown how to easily download any kaggle dataset into google colab.
